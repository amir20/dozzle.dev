        <p><strong>Live CPU and memory usage</strong> — see historical memory and cpu usage to easily see memory trend.</p>

        <p><strong>Search across many containers</strong> — quickly search containers using <key-shortcut label="k" /> to find logs for a specifc container.</p>

        <p><strong>Color-coded logs</strong> — log entries are color-coded and grouped based on their level (error, warning, info, etc.) to help you quickly identify issues.</p>

        <p><strong>Search</strong> — you can search logs for specific keywords or <code>/regex/</code> making it easy to find relevant log entries.</p>

        <p><strong>Split screen</strong> — able to view muliple logs at the same by spliting the screen between multiple containers.</p>

        <p><strong>Simple Authentication</strong> — simple username and password authentication supported out of the box.</p>
